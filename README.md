# BFS-ShortestPath
Given a graph finds the shortest path between two vertices using Breadth First Search

Programmed using C

Given an input file like __in.txt__

Gives the output file __out.txt__

File information:

__FindPath.c__ - take an input file and an output file and print the adjacency matrix and shortest paths of the requested vertices to the output file

__Graph.c__ - standard graph ADT implementaion file

__Graph.h__ - standard graph ADT header file

__List.c__ - standard list ADT implementation file

__List.h__ - standard list ADT header file

__Makefile__ - compiles the files
